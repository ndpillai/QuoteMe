QuoteMe is a social media application that allows users to post “Quotes” and attribute them to other Users. This is meant to allow people to give their friends credit for things they say in real life and display them in a public space. Users have distinct profiles, have a feed page to view Quotes from Users that they are following, can write (and attribute) their own quotes, and receive real-time notifications.

QuoteMe has an interactive graphical user interface that enables the Users to have the aforementioned capabilities. The QuoteMeUniverse is loaded from a central server and shared across all clients that connect, utilizing networking and multi-threading, and will persist across multiple sessions. Overall, the QuoteMe experience is intended to provide a unique social media platform for sharing “moments that matter.”

Requires javax.mail.jar to send email confirmations to users.

To run: run QuoteMeServer.java and then QuoteMeClient.java.
